# Preliminary Exploratory 

Let us have a first look at the data structures for each files since there are many files in this competition. 

## Aisles 

Aisles are simply the different food categories (passage) of a grocery store.
```{r}
head(aisles,30)
```



```{r}
glimpse(aisles)
summary(aisles)
length(unique(aisles$aisle_id))
```


## Departments


I will think of departments as a broader categorization as opposed to aisles. 

```{r}
head(departments,30)
```


```{r}
glimpse(departments)
summary(departments)
    
```



## Order Prior 

```{r}
head(orderp,30)
```


```{r}
glimpse(orderp)
summary(orderp)
```


## Order train 


```{r}
head(ordert,10)
```



```{r}
glimpse(ordert)
summary(ordert)
```



## Order 

```{r}
head(orders,30)
```


```{r}
summary(orders)
```



## Products 


```{r}
head(products,30)
```


```{r}
glimpse(products)
```




# Reshape, combine data structure 




Note that we have 6 data set, and we must restructure them. This image will summarize the data structures:

</p>


By looking at the orders dataset, users are categorized as train user and test user. And each user have a list of prior orders, which we can do features engineering on.

</p>





## Products dataframe

Let us first combine **products**, **departments** as well as **aisles** into one dataframe. 

```{r}
products <- products %>% 
  inner_join(aisles) %>% inner_join(departments) 
#%>% select(-aisle_id, -department_id)
rm(aisles, departments)

```

Let us view this new products dataframe 

```{r}
head(products,30)
```



**so far this data is not used. We can make use of this.**

## Create orders_products


Let us combine orders with order prior using inner join via their order id.

This will be the list of prior orders with its product information.

```{r}
orders_products <- orders %>% inner_join(orderp, by = "order_id") # combine data such that similar rows exist
```

```{r}
head(orders_products,30)
```

```{r}
colnames(orders_products)
```



## Product features of prior orders (from orders_products)

Some features based on unique products id:  

* prod_orders: total number of orders from unique users 
* prod_reorders: total number of reorders from all users (may be repeated)
* prod_first_orders: total number of first orders from all unique users (based on product_time)
* prod_second_orders: total number of second orders from all unique users (based on product_time)
